# Organic Reaction Prediction (CPU-based Transformer)

This project is a lightweight introduction to machine learning in chemistry.  
It adapts the idea from Schwaller et al. but is simplified to run on a CPU (low computational power than GPU).  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Explore how transformer-based models can predict organic reactions.

## Goal
Designed for students to learn machine learning concepts without needing GPU power. It's a work in progress, insights are appreciated.
