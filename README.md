# Organic Reaction Prediction (CPU-based Transformer)

This project is a lightweight introduction to machine learning in chemistry and cheminformatics.
The codes are divided into sections with small Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding.
It adapts the idea from Schwaller et al. but is simplified to run on a CPU with a much smaller dataset.  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Explore how transformer-based models can predict organic reactions.

## Goal
Designed to learn machine learning concepts without needing high computational power. It's a work in progress, insights are appreciated.
